### figures

The folder contains R scripts and associated data used to generate Fig.2H, Fig.3A, Fig.4, Fig.5, FigSI.7b, and FigSI.7c.

### maldi

The folder contains Matlab scripts used to analyze MALDI-TOF spectra and spectra data. 

### python_scripts

The folder contains Python scripts used to download and analyze CFG (Consortium for Functional Glycomics) glass array data.

### differential-testing

Contains code to use edgeR to compare LiGA seqeunce abundances, including data for one example case.

### process-fastq
